International students in the US will find the going tougher after the final policy guidelines were published by the US government.Starting August 9, students and their dependants will automatically begin to accrue unlawful presence in the US the day after they violate their “student status” even if the period of stay granted has not expired.The new policy reverses the prior rules under which the clock to calculate unlawful presence began to tick from the day the violation was found or an immigration judge passed an order.The tweaked policy has serious repercussions as individuals who accrue over 180 days of unlawful presence before they leave the US can be barred from re-entry for three to 10 years.International student data from the Open Doors Report (2017) shows that there are 1.86 lakh Indian students in the US.Under the revised final policy memorandum, international students who fall out of status and timely file (within five months) for reinstatement of that status will have their accrual of unlawful presence suspended while the application is pending.If the reinstatement application is denied, the accrual of unlawful presence resumes on the day after the denial, said an official USCIS statement.Cyrus D Mehta, New Yorkbased immigration attorney and managing partner of a law firm, explained to TOIthat the improvement (over the draft guidelines) is insignificant, especially for a student who may have unknowingly violated his/her status earlier.
